          <p><strong>Meaning:</strong> Cascading Style Sheets<br> <strong>
						Usage:</strong> CSS defines the look and feel of a webpage - it can change the size or layout of items on a page, change colors, fonts, and more!  CSS adds all the styling. It also handles the layout of the page (where elements go), so it is a bit more than just making it look good. It makes webpages usable and intuitive.</p>

          <p><strong>Meaning:</strong> HyperText Markup Language<br> <strong>Usage:</strong> HTML holds the content we see on a page (text, images) and defines the structure and order in which the content appears. We can think of HTML as the skeleton of our webpage; without it, we'd just be a blob.</p>
